# Chowkidaar - Security at your finger tips
To provide smart society security portal for residential safety.
### Problem Statement
1. Processing
    * The installation of a security survillance systems over a facility’s infrastructure needs to involve a security integrator skilled in networks. Yet, today’s most successful network,artificial intelligence and data storage setups that involve the expertise of a facility’s onsite technology team exist but is not implemented in correct manner in india. A lack of collaboration between these two groups during systems integration is a mistake of considerable consequences that take place in the residential areas.

2. Proposed System
    * A ML based platform that integrates with currently configured CCTV system in the society that helps the society to identify any ongoing/pervious suspicious activities such as any lethal assaults, fire/smoke detection. It also provides an interface where the guards/watchman can log the activity of the strangers.
    
    * Our portal will allow the login authentication on mobile app of three users present in any society i.e- security-guard, secretary,and the members residing in the building.The interface provided will log the already present members in society or building will already been known to the system and the new members/strangers will be marked too.
 
    * The next service is that of acquiring that if the member is present it their respective flats or not that if a stranger entering the building pretending to be going to the respective flat will be blocked at the entrance by the guard as the log says that the flat is empty and no-one is present.
    * The portal also provides fire as well as smoke detection along with the object gun detection wherein the model is trained to know how the object looks like
